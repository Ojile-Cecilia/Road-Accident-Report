## Introduction
This is an Excel project on road accident using data for the years 2021 and 2022.
Road safety is a significant concern impacting communities worldwide. In response to this issue, I have developed a Road Accident Analytics Dashboard.
The dashboard provides stakeholders with critical insights, enabling them to make informed, data-driven decisions to enhance road safety.

**_Disclaimer_** : _All datasets and reports do not represent any company, institution or country, but just a dummy datasets to demonstrate capabilities of Excel_.

## Problem Statement
1. Primary KPI: Total casualties taken place after the accident
2. Primary KPI: Total casualties and percentage of total with respect to accident severity and maximum casualties by type of vehicle
3. Secondary KPI: Total casualties with respect to vehicle type
4. Monthly trend showing comparism of casualties for current and previous year
5. Maximum casualties by Road type
6. Distribution of total casualties by Road surface
7. Relation between casualties by Area/Location and by Day/Night

## Skills/ concepts demonstrated:
The following Excel features were incorporated:
- Data Cleaning Data Transformation
- Filtering
- Conditional function.
- Pivot Tables and Pivot Chart
- Data Visulisation and Dashboard creation

## Stakaeholders
1. Ministry of transport
2. Road Transport Department
3. Police Force
4. Emergency Service Department
5. Road safety corps
6. Transport Operators
7. Traffic Management Agencies
8. Public
9. Media

## Metadata

# Key Insight
üìà Total Casualties Analysis: The dashboard shows a significant total of 417,883 casualties resulting from accidents over a two-year period. 

üìÖ Peak Months:The number of casualties was slightly higher in 2021 compared to 2022. The highest number of casualties occurred in October and November for both years, while January and February saw the fewest casualties.

üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Casualties by Vehicle Type: Car accidents were responsible for the majority of casualties, making up 79.8% of the total. Accidents involving other vehicle types resulted in minimal casualties.

ü©∏ Casualties by accident severity: Most casualties (84.1%) were of slight severity, with fatal severity casualties accounting for only 1.7%.

üë£ Road Type Analysis: Single carriageway roads had the highest number of casualties (310,100), whereas slip roads had the fewest (5,100).

‚õàÔ∏è Casualties Distribution by Road Surface: The majority of casualties (67%) occurred on dry road surfaces.

üâë Casualties Relation by Area/Location: Urban areas accounted for 61% of the casualties following accidents.

üåÉ Casualties Distribution by light condtion: Most casualties (73%) happened during daylight conditions.


# Recommendations
- The dashboard‚Äôs comparison of casualty trends between the current and previous years on a monthly basis highlights October and November as critical periods.
  During these high-risk months, the traffic police and other stakeholders must intensify their road safety measures.
- Car drivers account for the majority of casualties
  To address this, targeted awareness campaigns, strict monitoring, and periodic check-ups on safe driving practices are essential.
- Enhanced safety measures are necessary on single carriageway roads, and these roads should be upgraded to double lanes wherever feasible.
- By analyzing casualty distribution across different road surface conditions, the dashboard helps identify areas where road maintenance and surface improvements are crucial.
- Urban areas require focused interventions to improve road safety, particularly during daytime.

# Conclusion

The Road Accident Analytics Dashboard facilitates data-driven decision-making, empowering stakeholders to implement evidence-based interventions that enhance road safety. It serves as a valuable tool for policymakers, traffic authorities, and safety advocates.
